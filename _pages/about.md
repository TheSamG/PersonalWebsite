I recently graduated from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) with a B.A. in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) and a minor in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus). As of now, I am currently working as a research intern at the [Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://hilab.dev/) under the supervision of [Professor Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/).

My focus of research lies within the field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. Specifically within this field, I am most interested in **Interaction Technologies** such as hidden interfaces. I take a lot of inspiration from my Dad, who suffers from a myriad of movement, hearing, and sight impairments. In this regard, I hope that the technologies I create are both simple and intuitve such that even someone like my Dad could find them helpful. 

Outside of research, I'm either fishing at the local pier, or prepping for my next fighting-game tournament.
