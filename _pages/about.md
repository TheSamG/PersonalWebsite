I recently graduated from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) with a B.A. in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) and a minor in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus). As of now, I am currently applying for for PhD positions for Fall 2025.

My focus of research lies within the fields of **Computer Science** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. Specifically within this field, I am most interested in creating human-computer technologies to both understand and postively impact human health. 

Outside of research, I'm either fishing at the local pier, or prepping for my next fighting-game tournament.
