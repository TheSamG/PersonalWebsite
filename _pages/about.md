I recently graduated from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) with a B.A. in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) and a minor in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus). As of now, I am currently working as a research intern at the [Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://hilab.dev/) under the supervision of [Professor Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/).

My focus of research lies within the field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. Specifically within this field, I am most interested in **Interaction Technology**, **AI**, and **Accessibility**. I take a lot of inspiration from my Dad, who suffers from a myriad of movement, hearing, and sight impairments. I hope that through my research I can improve the lives of people like my Dad by improving the ease-of-use of day-to-day tasks through technologies and systems.

Outside of research, I'm either at the pier fishing for mackerel or prepping for my next fighting-game tournament.
